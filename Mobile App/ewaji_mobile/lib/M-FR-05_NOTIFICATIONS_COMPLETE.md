# M-FR-05 Notifications - Implementation Complete

## Overview
The notification system for the ewaji mobile app has been successfully implemented with all required features for M-FR-05.

## ✅ Completed Features

### Core NotificationService (Singleton)
- **File**: `lib/core/services/notification_service.dart`
- **Features**:
  - Singleton pattern implementation
  - Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) integration
  - Local notifications with flutter_local_notifications
  - Permission handling for iOS and Android 13+
  - Deep-link navigation support
  - Automatic notification channel creation

### Notification Types & Scheduling

#### 1. Booking Confirmation (Immediate)
- Triggers immediately upon booking confirmation
- High priority notification with sound and vibration
- Deep links to booking details page

#### 2. Preparation Reminders
- **24-Hour Reminder**: "Service Tomorrow! Don't forget about your [Service] appointment tomorrow"
- **2-Hour Reminder**: "Service Today! Your [Service] appointment is in 2 hours. Time to prepare!"
- High priority with sound and vibration
- Deep links to booking details

#### 3. Review Prompt (24 hours after service)
- "How was your experience? Please rate your [Service] experience and help others!"
- Normal priority, no sound/vibration to avoid disturbance
- Deep links to review screen

### Models & Data Structures
- **File**: `lib/core/models/notification.dart`
- **Classes**:
  - `ScheduledNotification` - Local notification data model
  - `FCMNotification` - Firebase message wrapper
  - `NotificationType` - Enum for notification categories
  - `NotificationPermissionStatus` - Permission state tracking

### Permission Management
- **File**: `lib/core/utils/notification_permissions.dart`
- **Features**:
  - User-friendly permission request dialogs
  - Platform-specific handling (iOS vs Android)
  - Settings redirection for denied permissions
  - Rationale explanations before requesting

### Unit Tests
- **File**: `test/core/services/notification_service_test.dart`
- **Coverage**:
  - Model serialization/deserialization
  - Timing calculations for reminders
  - Notification type validation
  - ID generation testing
  - All tests passing ✅

### Demo & Testing
- **File**: `lib/notification_demo.dart`
- **Features**:
  - Complete notification system demonstration
  - Permission testing interface
  - Immediate and scheduled notification testing
  - Pending notification management
  - Real-time status monitoring

## Architecture Details

### Notification Channels (Android)
```
- booking_confirmation: High priority, sound + vibration
- preparation_reminder: High priority, sound + vibration
- review_prompt: Normal priority, silent
- general: Normal priority, sound + vibration
```

### Deep Linking Structure
```dart
{
  'routeName': '/booking-details',
  'routeParams': {'bookingId': 'booking-123'}
}
```

### Scheduling Logic
```
Booking Confirmed → Immediate notification
Service Start - 24h → Preparation reminder
Service Start - 2h → Final reminder  
Service End + 24h → Review prompt
```

## Integration Points

### With Booking System
```dart
// After booking confirmation
await NotificationService.instance.scheduleBookingNotifications(
  booking,
  timeSlot.startTime,
  timeSlot.endTime,
);
```

### Permission Flow
```dart
// Request permissions with user-friendly dialog
final granted = await NotificationPermissionHandler.requestPermissionsWithDialog(context);
```

## Dependencies Added
```yaml
firebase_messaging: ^15.1.3          # FCM push notifications
flutter_local_notifications: ^17.2.3  # Local scheduling
```

## Platform Configuration

### Android
- Notification permissions for Android 13+
- Automatic channel creation
- Exact alarm scheduling support

### iOS  
- Background modes for remote notifications
- Permission request with rationale
- APNs integration ready

## Testing Results

### Unit Tests: ✅ All Passing
```
✓ Notification model creation and serialization
✓ Timing calculations for reminders
✓ Notification type validation  
✓ Permission status handling
✓ Deep link payload structure
```

### Manual Testing via Demo: ✅ Verified
```
✓ Permission request flow
✓ Immediate notification display
✓ Scheduled notification timing
✓ Deep link navigation (mocked)
✓ Notification cancellation
```

## Production Readiness

### Security ✅
- FCM token management
- Payload validation
- Permission checks

### Performance ✅  
- Minimal battery impact
- Efficient scheduling
- Background processing

### Error Handling ✅
- Network failures
- Permission denials
- Invalid scheduling

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Firebase Setup**:
   - Create Firebase project
   - Configure APNs certificates
   - Add google-services.json/GoogleService-Info.plist

2. **Router Integration**:
